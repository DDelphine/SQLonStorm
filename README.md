# SQLonStorm
Structured Query Language Distributed Parallel Stream Processing Based on Storm

###Analyze the structured query language based on syntax tree, simplify the syntax tree into components thatcan be deployed on Storm.
###Design a program that decompose a SQL query into independent sub-modules.
###Implement a program for Storm to initiate a topology of components dynamically for every on-line SQLquery.
###The independent sub-modules of SQL queries are deployed on Storm components for distributed parallelstream processing.
